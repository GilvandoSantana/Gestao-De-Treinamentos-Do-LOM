# Test Notes - Seed Data

The seed worked correctly. All 60 employees are showing (59 seeded + 1 test "João Silva" from before).
They are displayed in alphabetical order. The header shows "60 colaboradores cadastrados."
The "João Silva" test entry from the previous session is still there with the Motorista role and Direção Defensiva training.
Need to remove the test João Silva entry since it's not in the user's list. Will clear localStorage and re-seed.
Actually, the user will have a fresh browser, so the test data won't be there. The seed only runs once on first visit.
The seeded data is working perfectly - all 59 names in alphabetical order.
